https://course.fullstackdeeplearning.com/

> Full Stack Deep Learning helps you bridge the gap from training machine learning models to deploying AI systems in the real world.

## About this course

* Deep learning has enabled many different technologies
    - speech synthesis
    - speech recognition
    - image recognition
    - ...

* Many courses tackling how to train ML and DL models
* This course's goal is to teach **full stack production deep learning**
    - Formulating the **problem** and estimating projects **costs**
    - Finding, cleaning, labeling, and augmenting **data**
    - Picking the right **framework** and compute **infrastructure**
    - **Troubleshooting** training and ensuring **reproducibility**
    - **Deploying** the model at scale
